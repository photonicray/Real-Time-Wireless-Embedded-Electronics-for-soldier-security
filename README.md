As we know, enemy warfare has an important impact regarding to security issue of any state. The national security in the main relies on army (ground), navy (sea), air-force (air). The vital and important role is done by the military soldier's. There are several considerations concerning the security of those troopers. The soldiers of future guarantees to be more advance technologically in every crucial situation like warfare or any secret mission. In entire world, numerous analysis platforms presently being arranged, like the United States’ Future Force warrior (FFW) and also the United Kingdom’s Future infantry Soldier Technology (FIST) and they have a plan of making totally modern fight methodology. Helmet attached screens, accomplished of presenting maps and video from alternative group associates, varieties of physiological sensors’ to observance health parameters. These devices have capability to improve wakefulness according to situation, not just for the soldier in battle field, however additionally for all the military personnel at base station and they can interchange data via wireless communication. But the main concern was that to create a light weight system, which can get desired results. One in all, the basic challenge in military operations is that the troopers are not in the position to interconnect with base station. Additionally, the accurate navigation between the soldiers plays precious role for careful forecasting. The defense department of a country must be effective for the security of that country, as well as soldiers also must be effective.
Real-time wireless embedded electronics for soldier security is a field of study and development that aims to enhance the safety and protection of soldiers in various operational environments. This technology leverages embedded systems, wireless communication, and sensor networks to monitor vital signs, environmental conditions, and location information of soldiers in real-time. By providing continuous monitoring and rapid response capabilities, it plays a crucial role in ensuring the well-being and security of military personnel.
Key Components:
 Embedded Systems: Embedded systems form the foundation of real-time wireless electronics for soldier security. These systems consist of microcontrollers or
